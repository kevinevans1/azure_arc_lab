# Azure Arc Demo Lab
This repository contains a demonstration lab for showcasing the capabilities of Azure Arc. The lab includes examples of Azure Arc-enabled servers, Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server, and Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes.

## Overview
Azure Arc extends Azure management and services to any infrastructure, allowing you to bring Azure services and management to resources outside of Azure. This lab provides hands-on examples and tutorials to explore the functionalities and benefits of Azure Arc in different scenarios.

## Contents
The lab consists of the following sections:

Azure Arc-enabled servers: This section provides a step-by-step guide to deploying and managing Azure Arc-enabled servers. You will learn how to connect and manage on-premises servers, edge devices, and other cloud provider resources using Azure Arc.

Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server: Explore how to extend Azure SQL managed instance to your own infrastructure or other cloud providers using Azure Arc. You will learn how to deploy and manage Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server instances and benefit from Azure SQL managed instance features.

Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes: Discover the power of Azure Arc in managing Kubernetes clusters across different environments. This section demonstrates how to connect and manage Kubernetes clusters deployed on-premises or on other cloud providers using Azure Arc.

Each section includes detailed documentation, code samples, and step-by-step instructions to help you understand and deploy Azure Arc-enabled services in a practical manner.


## Prerequisites
To follow the lab exercises, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

An Azure subscription: You will need an active Azure subscription to create and manage Azure resources.

Azure CLI: Install the Azure CLI to interact with Azure services and resources from the command line.

Azure Arc extension for Azure CLI: Install the Azure Arc extension for the Azure CLI to manage Azure Arc-enabled resources.

Kubernetes CLI (kubectl): If you plan to work with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes, install the Kubernetes command-line tool (kubectl) to manage Kubernetes clusters.

# Onboarding a Hyper-V Virtual Machine for Azure Arc Demo Labs
This repository provides a step-by-step guide for onboarding a Hyper-V virtual machine (VM) to Azure Arc in order to leverage Azure management capabilities for on-premises or edge resources. By following this guide, you can easily connect your Hyper-V VM to Azure Arc and benefit from centralized management, monitoring, and deployment options.

# Overview
Azure Arc enables you to extend Azure management and services to resources outside of Azure, including Hyper-V virtual machines. With Azure Arc, you can centrally manage and govern your on-premises, multi-cloud, and edge resources from the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell. This guide focuses on onboarding a Hyper-V VM to Azure Arc, allowing you to manage it as if it were an Azure resource.

# Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. An Azure subscription: You will need an active Azure subscription to create and manage Azure resources.

2. Hyper-V host: Prepare a Hyper-V host with a virtual machine that you want to onboard to Azure Arc. Ensure that the Hyper-V host meets the hardware and software requirements.

3. Azure CLI: Install the Azure CLI on your local machine to interact with Azure services and resources.
